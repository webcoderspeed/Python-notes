# Introduction to Python:

> Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive & object-oriented scripting language.

## Python is High-Level Programming Language:

> Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation & it has fewer syntatical constructions than other languages.

## Python is Interpreted:

> Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter you don't need to compile your program before executing it.

## Python is Interactive:

> You can actually sit at a program prompt & interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

## Python is Object-Oriented:

> Python supports object-oriented style or techniques of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

# History of Python:

> Python was developed bu Guido Van Rossum in the late 1980's & early 1990's at the National Research Institute for Mathematics & Computer Science in the Netherland.

> Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, small Talk, Unix Shell & other scripting Languages.

# Need of Python Programming:

### 1) Software Quality:

> Python focus on readability, coherence & software quality in general sets it's apart from the other tools in the scripting world.

> Python has deep support for more advanced software reuse mechanisms, such as object-oriented programming.

### 2) Developer Productivity:

> Python code is typically one third to one-fifth the size of equivalent C++ or Java Code. That means there is less to type, less to debug & less to maintain.

> Python program also run immediately, without the lengthy compile and link steps required by some other tools, further boosting programmer speed.

### 3) Support Libraries:

> Python comes with a large collection of prebuilt & Portable functionality, knowns as the application-level programming tasks, from text pattern matching to network scripting.

> Python can be extended with both homo-grown libraries & a vast collection of third party application support software. Python's third-party domain offers tools for website construction, numeric programming, serial port access, game development & much more.

### 4) Easy to Understand:

> Begin a very high-level language, python reads like English, which takes a lot of syntax-learning stress off coding beginners.

> Python handles a lot of complexity for you, so it is very beginner friendly in that it allows beginners to focus on learning programming concepts & not have to worry about too much details.

### 5) Very Flexible:

> As a dynamically typed language, Python is really flexible. This means there are no hard rules on how to solving problems using different methods.

> Python is also more forgiving of errors, so you'll still be able to compile & run your program until you hit the problematic part.

# Application of Python:

##### The following are the applications of Python in a cable wide range of areas:

> - Web Applications
> - Desktop Applications
> - Database Applications
> - Web Scraping
> - Data Analysis
> - Interactive Web Visualization.
> - Computer vision for the image & video processing.
> - Object Oriented Programming

### Python In-Built Help for modules/function (urf Documentation):

> Type the below command in terminal window (cmd/ command prompt) which will then launch the python in-built documentation on browser on local server.

    python -m pydoc -b

> - -m is representing the module flag
> - -b is representing the browser flag
